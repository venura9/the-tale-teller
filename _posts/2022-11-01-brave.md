It's today! Today's the day for Neha to be be an outstanding superstar! She was going to rock the stage, everyone was shouting out "NEHA,NEHA,NEHA,NEHA!!!" The crowd was wild for a spectacular performance

Backstage, Neha was practicing her difficult lines with all her might. She felt slightly nervous but mostly... AWESOME! She apllied her makeup, practiced one last time and with glee, danced upstage. She took a few breaths before she danced onto the stage. It was now or never, the performance of a lifetime! She opened her mouth as the crowd settled and tried to sing gracefully. Instead, not a sound came out of her mouth. She was worried and even more nervous than before. She hesitated, then she remembered her parent's rap which was "Whenever your scared, remember these tips. Take 3 breaths and speak them out your lips!" So she whispered it in her head, took the three breaths and tried again

This time, the words flurished and flew out of her mouth and her voice sounded better then ever! Everyone's eyes looked at the future superstar with amazement and finished the perfect song with an avalanche of screams and claps.

What an exciting ending to a fabulous story. now it's time for a writing that reminds me of my very beloved mum. enjoy this RAINY story.
