The day was misty as birds flew to their dry nests as they chirped on the way. Dark clouds gathered around as powerful gusts of wind made trees of any size sway back and forth. Soon, in the blink of my eye, crystal clear droplets with many shapes and sizes fell to Earth as they took the heat away and cooled it down. Oh my god, it was raining and the rain had made trees and fruits shine as bright as the stars. "Rainy days are the best." I whispered to myself. A few seconds later, suddenly, the rain the reminded me of someone very special…  MY MUM!!

She is just like the wonderous rain. Thousands of thoughts came to my mind.

Just like rain, she is the best! The water droplets are like her wonderful kisses falling upon my face. She has that magical power to earase the sorrows, stress, anger and frustration like the rain cooling down the schorching heat from Earth. That cool feeling, is my love and happiness from....
