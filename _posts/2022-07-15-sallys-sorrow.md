Sally was a very gorgeous star,
But no one could see her ‘cause she was far.

  
However , Sally’s bright beautiful light,
Shone up the super dark night.

  
Thanks to her amazing glow,
All the others could see it flow.

  
At night you see her right away,
But disappears in the bright day.

  
Her mother, the sun said to STOP!
Or else she might even pop!

  
“I won’t pop!” She said with mirth,
“I haven’t popped ever since birth."

  
But that old sun was so very smart,
She knew Sally would pop like a dart.

  
But poor little Sally was So very dumb,
She popped and left a little crumb.

  
Now the sun has a really big sorrow,
and left Sally's crumb in a big burrow.
