Sally was a very gorgeous star,
<br/>But no one could see her ‘cause she was far.

However, Sally’s bright beautiful light,
<br/>Shone up the super dark night.

Thanks to her amazing glow,
<br/>All the others could see it flow.

At night you see her right away,
<br/>But disappears in the bright day.

Her mother, the sun said to STOP!
<br/>Or else she might even pop!

“I won’t pop!” She said with mirth,
<br/>“I haven’t popped ever since birth."

But that old sun was so very smart,
<br/>She knew Sally would pop like a dart.

But poor little Sally was So very dumb,
<br/>She popped and left a little crumb.

Now the sun has a really big sorrow,
<br/>and left Sally's crumb in a big burrow.
